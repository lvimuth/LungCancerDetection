# Lung Cancer Detection and Prediction System

## Introduction
This project utilizes CT scan images to detect and predict the stages of lung cancer early, using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Connected Component Labeling.

## Project Description
Lung cancer remains a major health issue worldwide. This system aims to leverage technology to enhance early diagnosis and treatment options. It involves:
- Using image processing to identify cancerous cells in CT scans.
- Employing CNN architectures to predict the stage of detected cancerous nodules.
